\usage{
bootMargin(
  CC,
  CE = NULL,
  EE = NULL,
  thr = 0.5,
  reps = 10000,
  conf.level = 0.95,
  delete = FALSE,
  plot = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{CC}{Three-dimensional matrix, where each submatrix along the z-axis is a
square and reflective incidence matrix, or a list of data.frames containing
square and reflective incidence matrices. Each matrix represents a complete
graph.}

\item{CE}{Three-dimensional matrix, where each submatrix along the z-axis is a
rectangular incidence matrix, or a list of data.frames containing rectangular
 incidence matrices. Each matrix represents a bipartite graph. By default CE = NULL.}

\item{EE}{Three-dimensional matrix, where each submatrix along the z-axis is a
square and reflective incidence matrix, or a list of data.frames containing square
and reflective incidence matrices. Each matrix represents a complete graph.
By default EE = NULL.}

\item{thr}{Real between [0,1]: Defines the degree of truth for which the incidence
is considered significant. By default thr = 0.5.}

\item{reps}{The number of bootstrap replicas. By befault reps = 10.000.}

\item{conf.level}{Real between [0,1]: Defines the confidence level.
By default conf.level = 0.95.}

\item{delete}{Logical: If delete = TRUE, it deletes rows and columns whose incidences
are significantly less than the set thr. By default delete = FALSE.}

\item{plot}{Logical: If plot = TRUE, creates a graph from the results obtained.
By default plot = FALSE.}
}
\value{
The function returns a list with subsets of data.
The subset $byRow and $byCol contains the following values:
\itemize{
 \item{Var: }{Variable name.}
 \item{Mean: }{Calculated mean.}
 \item{LCI: }{Lower Confidence Interval.}
 \item{UCI: }{Upper Confidence Interval.}
 \item{p.value: }{The calculated p-value.}
}
For delete = TRUE with complete graphs, the function returns $Data, the matrix entered
 in the CC parameter, but with the non-significant rows and columns removed.

For delete = TRUE with chained bipartite graphs, the function returns $CC, $CE, $EE
, the three-dimensional matrices entered in the parameters CC, CE and EE, but
eliminating the non-significant rows and columns.

For plot = TRUE, the function returns the subset $plot, which contains the graph
generated from the data $byRow and $byCol. On the X axis there is "dependency"
associated with $byCol and on the Y axis "influence" associated with $byRow.
}
\description{
It performs the calculation of the mean incidence for each cause and each effect,
 confidence intervals and p-value with multiple key informants for complete graphs
  and chained bipartite graphs for multiple experts. The function allows eliminating
   causes and effects whose average incidence is not significant at the set thr.

\details{
bootMargin


The function implements "boot.one.bca" from the wBoot package to obtain the confidence intervals and the p-value.
The function contemplates two modalities, the first is focused on complete graphs and the second for chained bipartite graphs.
If you use the full graph mode, make sure to keep the default values of the CE and EE parameters.

\examples{
# For complete graphs only the CC parameter is used.
# For instance:
# # bootMargin(CC = AA, thr = 0.5, reps = 500)
# For chain bipartite graphs the parameters CC, CE and EE are used.
# For instance:
# # bootMargin(CC = AA, CE = AB, EE = BB, thr = 0.5, reps = 500)
