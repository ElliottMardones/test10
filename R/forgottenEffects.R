#' @title Forgotten Effects For Complete Graphs
#' @aliases fe.sq
#' @name fe.sq
#'
#' @description Perform the forgotten effects calculation proposed by Kaufmann and Gil-Aluja (1988)
#'  with multiple key informants. Parameters allow you to specify the significant degree of truth and
#'  the order of incidence that is required to be calculated for complete multi-expert graphs.
#'  The function returns the frequency of appearance of the forgotten effect, its mean incidence,
#'  the confidence intervals and the standard error in each order.
#'
#' @param CC Three-dimensional matrix, where each submatrix along the z-axis is a square and
#' reflective incidence matrix, or a list of data.frames containing square and reflective
#' incidence matrices. Each matrix represents a complete graph.

#' @param thr Real between [0,1]: Defines the degree of truth for which the incidence
#' is considered significant. By default thr = 0.5.

#' @param maxOrder Positive integer greater than 1: Defines the maximum order
#'  of the forgotten effects. By default maxOrder = 2.

#' @param reps The number of bootstrap replicas. By default reps = 10.000.

#' @param parallel The type of parallel operation to use (if applicable).
#' The options are "multicore", "snow" and "no". By default parallel = "no".

#' @param ncpus Integer: Number of processes that will be used in the parallel
#' implementation. By default ncpus = 1.


#'
#' @details The function extends the theory of forgotten effects proposed by Kaufmann and Gil-Aluja (1988),
#'  to find indirect cause-effect relationships from direct cause-effect relationships, in the
#'  case of multiple experts.
#' The parallel and ncpus options are not available on Windows operating systems.

#' @return The function returns a list with subsets of data.
#' $boot: List of data.frame for each of the generated commands, contains the following components:

#' \item{From}{Indicates the origin of the forgotten effects relationships.}
#' \item{Through_x}{Dynamic field representing the intermediate relationships of the forgotten effects.
#' For example, for order n there will be "though_1" up to "though_ <n-1>" \eqn{though_(n-1)}.}
#' \item{To}{Indicates the end of the forgotten effects relationships.}
#' \item{Count}{Number of times the forgotten effect was repeated.}
#' \item{Mean}{Mean effect of the forgotten effect.}
#' \item{LCI}{Lower Confidence Intervals.}
#' \item{UCI}{Upper Confidence Intervals.}
#' \item{SE}{Standard error.}

#'$byExperts: List of data.frames for each of the generated orders that contains the incidence
#' values for each of the relationships found by the expert, the components are:
